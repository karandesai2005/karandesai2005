🚀 I'm currently working on  
Developing TraceProbe, a real-time log analysis tool with Apache Flink and Kafka for anomaly detection, and PenForge, a GUI-based security toolkit manager using Python and Docker to enhance vulnerability testing efficiency.

🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on  
Cybersecurity projects, Web3 solutions with smart contracts, or backend development using Node.js and React Native—focused on secure systems and automation.

🤔 I'm looking for help with  
Optimizing Apache Flink data streams, securing Docker containers, or integrating MetaMask for decentralized authentication.

🌱 I'm currently learning  
Network security via my CCNA certification, blockchain development, and cloud computing as a Google Gemini Student Ambassador.

💬 Ask me about  
Cybersecurity, penetration testing with Wireshark and Splunk, or my hackathon wins in steganography and web pentesting.

⚡ Fun fact  
I built an automated infra monitoring solution in 48 hours to win a hackathon—proof I can deliver under pressure!  

Support my work with a coffee ☕ and help me keep building secure, innovative tech!
